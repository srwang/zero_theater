			<h3>Zero Theater is a collaborative network for artists and curators that supports and connects makers of objects, environments, and live events anywhere in the real (site) or digital world (non-site). Borrowing from the theatrical concepts of adaptation, rehearsal and workshopping, it builds opportunities for criticality, dialogue, and feedback into processes of making, documenting, presenting, and curating art. Zero Theater employs a system of geo-tagging and other meta-data to track and record the art created within its network.</h3>

			<h3>About Zero Theater... On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain</h3>
